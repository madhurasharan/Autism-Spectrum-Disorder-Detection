# This file was created as an alternative Streamlit UI for the project.
# Since you want to revert to the original Flask UI, you can safely delete this file if you want.
# No changes are needed to the original Flask app files.
# To revert fully, just do not run or deploy this Streamlit app.
# The original Flask app is in app.py and uses the templates and static folders.
